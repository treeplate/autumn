# autumn

A simple clicker game set in the season of autumn (not fall, the season's name is ***autumn***) where you click a pumpkin, and can buy autoclickers with pumpkins.

Written in Dart+Flutter, with the pumpkin icon as a RenderBox/LeafRenderObjectWidget and an InkResponse with a custom ShapeBorder. This app was my first time using Flutter Widget Preview, and I didn't run `flutter run` even once when making this app.

i wrote main.dart and readme.md, everything else is autogenerated by Flutter
